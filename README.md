# handwriting-recognition-model
This project's primary goal is to create a system for handwriting recognition utilizing machine learning models. The objective is to precisely translate handwritten text into a digital format. To solve the problem of digitizing handwritten content, an algorithm model that can identify and understand human handwriting must be developed.
